## PRACTICAL

For the practical, in the data folder we have two datasets on Darwin's finches on the Gal√°pagos island of Daphne Major:  
- Finch Beak 1975: The beak measurement of the finches recorded in 1975.
- Finch Beak 2012: The beak measurement of the finches recorded in 2012.

The variable band is the index, species is finches species (fortis, scandens), beak_length is finches beak length, beak_depth is finches beak depth.

Task 1: Load data into R and combine the two datasets

Task 2: Do you see any data quality issues? Can you address them before continuing on with further analysis?

Task 3: How did beak length change from 1975 to 2012?

Task 4: How did beak depth change from 1975 to 2012?

Task 5: Is there a correlation between beak length and depth? Has it changed over time?

Task 6: Make a function to import and combine the two datasets into a single tibble

Task 7: Make a function to summarise the change in either beak length change or beak depth change
